    <dt id="click-me">Our star!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">One million Earths could fit inside the sun – and the sun is considered an average-size star.</dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Mars is kind of wet!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">For years it was believed that Earth was the only planet in our solar system with liquid water. More
        recently, NASA revealed its strongest evidence yet that there is intermittent running water on Mars, too!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Comets are old af!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Comets are leftovers from the creation of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago – they consist of
        sand, ice and carbon dioxide.
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Some planets be gassy!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You would not be able to walk on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune because they have no solid
        surface!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Pluto so far away. So very very far away.</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">If you could fly a plane to Pluto, the trip would take more than 800 years!</dd>

    <dt id="click-me">We are already effing up space!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Space junk is any human-made object orbiting Earth that no longer serves a useful purpose. Scientists
        estimate there are about 500,000 pieces of space junk today, including fragments from rockets and satellites, and everyday
        items like spanners dropped during construction of the International Space Station!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">The earth has a shield that burns stuff up, I guess.</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> An asteroid about the size of a car enters Earth’s atmosphere roughly once a year – but it burns up
        before it reaches us. Phew!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Big things are out there!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The highest mountain known to man is on an asteroid called Vesta. Measuring a whopping 22km in height,
        it is three times as tall as Mount Everest!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">Stars abound!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a
        billion trillion!
    </dd>

    <dt id="click-me">For a red planet, this is pretty weird!</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The sunset on Mars appears blue.</dd>
